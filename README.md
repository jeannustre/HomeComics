# Home Comics

Decentralized CBZ reader for iOS, written in Swift - read comics from the network or download your books from your library as you leave home.
Designed to work with a local REST api.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

* XCode 8
